# Caesar Cipher
By - Mohammed Aljubori

I made this PC applicaion using Java, it takes in any string input and a key number to encrypt text; it also has the ability to decrypt text given the correct key. 

## Example
Input : 
* String: "I love Github"
* Key: 3

Output : 
* String: "L oryh Jlwkxe"

**Since the given key was 3, the letters are shifted 3 letters to the right in the alphabetical order and vice versa for de-cryption.**
